# MedicalGAN
 Working on Image to Image translation using conditional GAN.

# Todo list
Make function for test of the sample (over all data or half data? Don't know)
Experiment with hyperparameters

# Some advice
Maybe not:
In sample_images(), you can get discriminator output as well for the fake image. Do that! And display it on image itself along with the psnr, ssim.
